# [Website demo](https://promyshlenie.netlify.app/)

## 🔹 This is a landing page for a startup that never took off.

## 🔹 The design is based on a presentation that the client provided.

## 🔹 No frameworks or libraries were used, this is a pure HTML, SCSS & JS project.

## 🔹 The team worked in sprints using Agile principles, each team member was responsible for transferring a set of pages from the presentation mockup to HTML and SCSS. We worked in branches and merged features onto main.

## 🔹 It was a very enjoyable experience where we practiced our frontend skills and learnt a lot about Git and GitHub and working in teams. 👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻👩‍💻
